# Requirements for Inventory Management System

# This is a browser-based (HTML/JS) project.
# No Python or Node.js dependencies are required for basic usage.
# To run locally, you only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

# If you want to run a local server for better file access (recommended for some browsers):
# Install Python (https://www.python.org/)
# Then run:
#   python -m http.server
# and open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

# External JS libraries used (included in project or via CDN):
# - Chart.js (for charts)
# - jsQR (for QR/barcode scanning)

# If you want to use npm for dependency management (optional):
# npm install chart.js jsqr

# No backend/server required.
